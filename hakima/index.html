        <p>Christmas is this Monday, which means a lot of family time for some people and a lot of traveling for others.

Whether you're a traveler looking for a cup of coffee or quick bite to eat, or a family who doesn't want to cook at home and deal with all those dirty dishes, unfortunately there may not be a lot of restaurant options available on Christmas this year.

While some of the bigger chain restaurants and coffee shops, like McDonald's and Starbucks, have store hours that vary by location, others, like Chick-fil-A and Cracker Barrel, will be closed on Dec. 25.

Regardless of if you're looking for a fast food restaurant or a sit-down experience, it is always a good idea to reach out to the restaurant to inquire about their specific holiday hours</p>
    
    
    <p>A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.[1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments</p>
    
    <p>The word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word restaurer 'provide food for', literally 'restore to a former state'[2] and, being the present participle of the verb,[3] The term restaurant may have been used in 1507 as a "restorative beverage", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean 'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'</p>
